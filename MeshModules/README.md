# MeshModules

This directory contains mesh generation and manipulation tools using Gmsh and other meshing libraries.

## Purpose

Tools for creating computational meshes for finite element and finite difference simulations, including:
- Complex geometry creation with Gmsh
- Fault embedding in 3D volumes
- Mesh refinement and optimization
- Mesh format conversions
- Quality control utilities

## Typical Use Cases

- Creating meshes with embedded fault surfaces
- Generating structured/unstructured grids
- Mesh preprocessing for earthquake simulations
- Topography and geological structure meshing

## Requirements

Common dependencies for mesh generation:
```bash
pip install gmsh numpy meshio
```
